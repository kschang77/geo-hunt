# Instructions

This is an app that takes a user, determines his or her location, and generates clues based on their location of different landmarks close by.

## Rules

A user starts with 1000 points. Once the game begins, the timer will start, which will decrement the points every second by 3 points. When a user enters a wrong answer, the counter is decremented by 50 points. When a user accesses the main game, a map will show up with a clue as to where the landmark is located, within 15 to 100 yards. Every 15 seconds, a new clue comes up. If the user needs a new hint, then the user will press the "New Hint" button for a new hint. Once the question is answered correctly, the user moves to the next question. The game ends when the user has answered all the questions with some portion of their points left, or when the user runs out of points. The user can then log their high score to a table.

First, install the app and dependencies on your machine.
