// Here’s what I have so far. I’ll send the completed one later tonight

// Kasey K.S. Chang  6:34 PM
// That's good, thanks. @Will Gibson is working on the clue generator and the "expedition server". We will meet tomorrow to discuss how to turn his fields into clues (which ones are suitable and which ones are not), and how to mix them with the clues you've created to meet the "25 clues" goal for each hunt target. Then the game is mostly complete.
// Just to emphasize, @Dan Fellows as Will already agreed, please test the client. Right now the game is hardcoded for Twin Peaks and Chinatown Gate, with placeholder clues. Please test the game, check the scoring mechanism, offer feedback on the game mechanics, where it can be improved, and so on. Should we REVERSE the presentation of clues? Right now, new clues are added at the BOTTOM. Should we reverse it so the latest clues are ON TOP? And stuff like that.
// 6:35
// Oh, and color. Do we need borders? Different color palette? etc.
// 6:36
// We'll  meet in class at 10AM and continue discussion. Great job, everyone. We got this in the bag.
// 6:37
// great job

// Dan Fellows  7:39 PM
// Thanks @Kasey Chang!!!

// Will Gibson  10:05 PM
// @Kasey Chang Seriously great job on the game so far, it’s really coming together. A couple of notes…
// Might be nice to have the +/- button on the Google Map like it is in streetview, not sure if that’s possible with the API or not. If not maybe directions for “scroll to zoom” (I lost pegman for a bit and the easiest way to find him is to zoom super far out)
// When the user arrives at the location a prominent “Congratulations you’ve arrived at Dragon Gate!!” type of message would be good
// Dan’s hints are pretty straightforward so not sure if anyone would be completely lost after seeing all of them but I think an active “Distance from Target” and Compass Heading would be nice to show on the page somewhere so people could be moving on the map even if they got stuck on a clue. This would be super helpful when they’re really close to the target but just outside of the accuracy radius
// I know we need to focus on core functionality first but the styling/spacing of the elements of the page should definitely be a priority after that. Things like a theme with header and footer, score and amount being subtracted from the score bigger and more prominent, padding on the map and streetview, title centered, etc. are things that would be nice if we have the time
// Just realizing this but are we using React at all on the client side? I know we talked about not using it for the Maps/Streetview but I think it’s a requirement of the project so if we don’t we should be able to just throw your current clients side files into a React app that serves it up right?

// Kasey K.S. Chang  1:03 AM
// Not a problem putting the zoom controls back.
// I will switch the alert to a modal like program start
// I can leave the buttons in with a 50 pt penalty, and it only gives directions in 0.5 km and 8 compass directions
// Discuss this in meeting at 10AM
// No react on client side at this point. Remember? We tried it and it started rendering WITHOUT even the map tag being included. It's totally ****ed up. Trust me, I researched this, tried like 4-5 different React-Googlemaps libraries over a whole week, spending many of my own hours. They either can't do StreetView, or they are written in a way I can't really customize it with addtional functionalities being a barebone wrapper. I want to use react, but it's just not working out for me. I can switch to Leaflet, but it's too late to toss out streetview at this point, I think.

// Kasey K.S. Chang  2:38 AM
// @Will Gibson @Dan Fellows Added zoom control back, switched all alerts to modals. Please test and make sure I don't have any bad modal dialog boxes (zeros, undefined, etc.) displaying. Will discuss the two "hint" buttons when we meet. Should not take more than two hours to convert them to modals and display them as imprecise hints. (more like 30 minutes, but like Scotty, one must quadruple estimates to be considered a miracle worker, hahaha!) (edited)
